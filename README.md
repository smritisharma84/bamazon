# bamazon


Bamazon is an Amazon-like storefront built with MySQL and Node.js. 

Within the customer portal, you can view the inventory, choose an item you'd like to purchase
along with the quantity, and voila! Transaction complete! However, if we do not have enough 
of the selected item in stock deeming us unable to fulfill your purchase, the transaction 
will not go through.

Within the manager portal, you can view all inventory in the store, view all low
inventory (less than 5 items in stock), choose to up the inventory back to the correct amount
needed, and even add new items to your inventory!
